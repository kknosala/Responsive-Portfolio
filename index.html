                    My name is Kurt Knosala. I am currently a technical trainer at Good Sam Camping World but I am transitioning into Full Stack Development. I enrolled in a Full Stack boot camp at DU and expect to complete the course by the end of November.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will be learning several other programs and languages as the boot camp progresses. I have a strong background in sales and customer service training as well as public speaking for large groups of people. I am detail-oriented and enjoy problem solving.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My current goal is to find a position where I can utilize the skills I am learning and where I can grow professionally. My ideal workplace is a strongly cooperative place that values its team members and also works to develop their skills as well as proving challenging work.
                </p>
